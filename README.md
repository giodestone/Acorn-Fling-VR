The theme was "What Does Home Mean To You" and for us a defining feature of home are trees and so we made a game about putting trees on planets. You get the trees on other planets by spinning them and firing tree seeds from your planet across space to (hopefully) another planet.

# Installation

[Download Here!](https://github.com/giodestone/Acorn-Fling-VR/releases)

Try below first, but you may have to enable developer side loading, to do so go to Settings > Update & Security > For Developers > Select Developer Mode.

1. Select the version for your system (x64 if unsure, Win32 if it fails). 
2. Then right click and select Properties > Digital Signatures > Select Signature from the list > Click 'Details'  > Click 'View Certificate' > Click 'Install Certificate' > Click 'Current User'
3. Then double click Acorn_Fling_1.0.0.0_[x64/Win32].appx and follow the instructions on the installer.

**Or alternatively download source and boot up with Unity Editor** (made on 2018.3.3f1 but newer versions probably work).

# How to play
Using the left controller press down the trigger and rotate the controller. Then once you're happy with the momentum your planet has press on the touch-pad to fire a weapon.
